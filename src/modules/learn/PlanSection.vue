        One of the most effective things you can do to prevent suicide deaths is
        to reduce the access that at-risk individuals have to the most lethal
        means of suicide, particularly firearms and dangerous medications.

          Greater than 90% of those who attempt and survive do not go on to die

          When people are really down and thinking about hurting themselves,
          having a gun around can be more of a danger than a source of

          individual). Collaborate with the at-risk person to find people that

          suggest a plan to reduce access.
